# mbank_ynab_parser

This is a simple python script for making mBank CSV file usable with this parser https://aniav.github.io/ynab-csv/

Yep, you're reading right - this is parser for parser :D

## Usage

1) `convert_csv.py -i <path to inputfile> -o <path to outputfile> `
    
   Will work with paths from the same directory or from fullpath
2) Go to https://aniav.github.io/ynab-csv/ and upload generated file
3) Download the YNAB-ready file
4) Import to YNAB

You can ask for help with:
`convert_csv.py -h`

## Planned improvements

1) better fit with "Regularne oszczÄ™dzanie"
2) better fit for transfers between owned accounts
3) maybe some screaming capslocked values for fields that don't have something relevant
4) maybe refactor :D
