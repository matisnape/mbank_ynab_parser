# mbank_ynab_parser

This is a simple python script for making mBank CSV file for import in YNAB

## Assumptions & Info

- the script is written for Python 3, although it should work under 2 as well
- the script is assuming having multiple accounts inside YNAB - you're prompted to decide about ignoring internal incoming transfers to avoid duplicate transactions (example for True: keeps A->B but ignores B<-A)
- you need to specify the account and credit card data in `constants.py` - name you would like to see in the file and the account number

## Usage

0) Create `constants.py` file from template
    `cp constants.template.py constants.py`
1) `convert_csv.py <path to inputfile>`

available options:

`-h` - help

`-c` - for parsing credit card csv

`-ii` - for ignoring internal transactions

   Note: Will work with paths from the same directory or from fullpath
   Note: Output file will be named `YNAB_ready_inputfile.csv`
2) Go to YNAB
3) Import file to appropriate account

## Planned improvements
- maybe some screaming capslocked values for fields that don't have something relevant
- tests

## Changelog
PR 3
- support for credit card statements
- introduced classes for account & credit card
- replaced getopt with argparse for command line arguments
- cleanup in command line arguments

PR 2
- refactored some stuff
- removed output file option (just generating the new file based on the input)
- prompting user for decision about ignoring internal incoming transactions

PR 1
- better fit with "Regularne oszczÄ™dzanie"
- better fit for transfers between owned accounts
