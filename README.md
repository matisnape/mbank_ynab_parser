# mbank_ynab_parser

This is a simple python script for making mBank CSV file for import in YNAB

## Assumptions & Info

- the app is written for Python 3, although it should work under 2 as well
- the app is assuming having multiple accounts inside YNAB - you're prompted to decide about ignoring internal incoming transfers to avoid duplicate transactions (example for True: keeps A->B but ignores B<-A)
- you need to specify the account and credit card data in `constants.py` - name you would like to see in the file and the account number

## Usage

0) Create `constants.py` file from template
    `cp constants.template.py constants.py`
1) `convert_csv.py -i <path to inputfile>`

   Note: Will work with paths from the same directory or from fullpath
   Note: Output file will be named `YNAB_ready_inputfile.csv`
2) Decide about ignoring incoming internal transactions: `y/n`
3) Go to YNAB
4) Import file to appropriate account

You can ask for help with:
`convert_csv.py -h`

## Planned improvements

- maybe some screaming capslocked values for fields that don't have something relevant
- maybe refactor :D
- tests

If the issue has to do with your csv file, please create a new gist (https://gist.github.com/) with the content of the CSV file and share the link in the issue. If you tweak the CSV file before sharing, just make sure whatever version you end up sharing still causes the problem you describe.
